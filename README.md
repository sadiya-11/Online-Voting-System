# Online-Voting-System

The Online Voting System is a web-based application designed to simplify and secure the voting process for elections. It provides functionalities for both administrators and voters. Administrators can create elections, add candidates, and monitor election statuses, while voters can view active elections, explore candidate details, and cast their votes easily. The system is built on core CRUD operations to handle various tasks efficiently. Administrators can create new elections and candidates, read election and candidate data, update existing records such as election details or candidate information, and delete outdated or incorrect entries. Voters interact with the system by viewing election data and submitting their votes. Developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system offers a streamlined, user-friendly experience for managing and participating in elections.
